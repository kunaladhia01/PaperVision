# PaperVision
## By combining paper with computing, the possibilities are endless.

#### Simplistic
PaperVision is based on something as simple as paper. Paper's ubiquity and people's famiiliarity with it makes PaperVision simple to use as grasp.

#### Stylistic
With a pen in hand, paper by your side, and a mind bursting with imagination, it has never been easier to bring life to your creative styles. With PaperVision, what you write and draw quickly becomes a interactive, digital creation.


#### Scalable
All PaperVision requires is a camera, a piece of paper, and a pen. This makes it easy for anyone to access and expand the horizons of what PaperVision can help them accomplish.

# Products

## GraphVision
GraphVision is an unique software tool which alows one to convert a function written on paper into an interactive function represented digitally. All one has to do is simply sketch the function on a blank piece of paper. The image is taken and overlayed onto a Cartesian coordinate plane. The graph is then fitted to a polynomial curve.

## MazeVision
Mazes themselves can be very difficult to create, let alone navigate. With MazeVision, simply sketch a maze and take a picture, and with the click of a button, your paper maze has been transformed into a computer game for everyone to enjoy.

## Our Vision
PaperVision is a suite of products that makes designing simpler by the day. All people, not only those who are experts, will be able to design digital masterpieces. In the future, we hope to include more products in our suites. We are currently working on Space Invaders, in which the hand-drawn enemies can be dynamically changed in the course of the game. We have also started implementing an online platform to let users post designs and share their thoughts with each other.
